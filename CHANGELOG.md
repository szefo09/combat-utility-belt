# Changelog

## [Known Issues]
> Some issues related to the upgrade to Active Effects can be resolved/mitigated by **Saving your Condition Lab** after updating to a CUB version greater than 1.3.0. Please try this before reporting an issue!

1. Loading a world with an existing Condition Lab mapping from pre CUB v1.3.0 may cause any Conditions added to a token to default to the first mapped condition. WORKAROUND: After loading your world, go into the Condition Lab and click Save.
2. Enhanced Conditions chat output for linked Tokens and Actors is not aggregated, so you may see multiple messages when many conditions are added/removed from an Actor/Token.
3. Overlay Effects added to a token will trigger the matching non-Overlay Condition to output to chat. The reverse is also true.
4. **PF2e users**: Enhanced Conditions `Output to Chat` setting will cause duplicate chat messages due to similar function built into the system.
5. Chat log may not re-render when Hide Names settings are changed. This may cause the old name to still show in the log for players. Advise players to reload Foundry if you change these settings mid-session.
6. *Ô∏è‚É£The Default/Inferred Condition Lab Mappings for game systems may not correctly import all data. Importing the map from the CUB Condition Maps folder imports correctly.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-06-15
### Enhanced Conditions
- `Active Effects Config` can be opened from the **Condition Lab** again!
- Changes made in the `Active Effects Config` are shown without closing and reopening the form, and are saved to the attached Condition on Submit.
- `Active Effects` attached to Conditions can now be Exported and Imported in the Condition Lab
- **Condition Lab** `reference` entries for Conditions are now a text-input (Id) field linking to any entity in your Foundry instance (eg. Actor, Item, JournalEntry, Compendium JournalEntry etc). The field is in the format of `@EntityType[entityId]{DisplayName}` This field now accepts drag-drop similar to dropping an entity into a Journal Entry (or other enriched text entry). If the dropped Id resolves correctly, a link to the entity will show up next to the Id. You can also put good ol' plain text in this field if you want.
> Note: the reference entry's `DisplayName` or text will override the Condition Name.
- The drag handles in the **Condition Lab** have been removed in favour of simpler up/down arrows ("chevrons" if we're being pedantic). A future update may add drag handles or more advanced order-sorting to the Lab
- Added support for the `Ironclaw 2e` system. Thanks to @hertzila! üéâ
- Conditions are no longer output to chat if the `Output to Chat` setting is disabled in **CUBputer**. Additionally, When this setting is disabled the related checkboxes in the **Condition Lab** cannot be changed.
### Triggler
- When **Triggler** executes a macro it now passes the triggering token/actor to the macro for downstream usage.
- Fixed logic in **Triggler** related to checking the ownership of the triggering actor/token.
### Temporary Combatants
- **Temporary Combatants** now work with Foundry VTT v0.8.x
### Hide Names
- **Hide Names** Actor button no longer disappears (üê±‚Äçüë§ ninja-style) after saving the form.

### Translations
- Updated `ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥` (Korean) translation (thanks @drdwing! üéâ)
- Replaced `Castellano` (`es-ES`) translation with `Espa√±ol` (`es`) (thanks @wallacemcgregor! üéâ)

## [1.5.0] - 2021-05-31
> Note: due to the large-scale changes introduced in [Foundry VTT v0.8.6](https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.8.6) you may experience some üêõbugs with this release. Please install the [Bug Reporter](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/bug-reporter) module to report issues, or file them on Github directly*
- Added compatibility for Foundry VTT v0.8.6
- **Award XP** now features a swish üåü new interface for selecting exactly which player and non-player characters are awarded/grant XP. Thanks to @wibble199 for this awesome addition! üéâ
- Improved the robustness üí™ of some of the logic throughout the module
- **CUBputer** gadget selector now extends to the title of the gadget, making it more intuitive for new users
- Slightly improved the alignment of condition rows in **Enhanced Conditions** chat output. Also a border appeared around them somehow...? Let's just go with it!
- ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) translation updated! Thanks @drdwing! üéâ
- ‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese) translation updated! Thanks @fuyuennju üéâ

## [1.4.0] - 2021-02-07
### Added
- Triggler now includes an **Advanced Trigger** type and associated fields that allow you to manually enter the path to the Actor/Token properties you want to listen for in your trigger. This provides compatibility for game systems not previously supported by Triggler, as well as allowing for listening for changes to properties that were not previously exposed in the dropdown menus.
*Note: This functionality will require some knowledge of the data model for your game system. Please check in the game system documentation or contact game system developers before contacting Death Save Development for assistance.*

### Changed
- Triggler form no longer closes when you click Save
- Triggler Cancel button replaced with a Reset button that resets the form back to its saved values
- Hide Names button on Actor sheets has been moved to the title bar (aka window header) 
- Updated Japanese translation (thanks @brothersharper !)

### Fixed
- Triggler is now compatible with all game systems via the **Advanced Trigger** functionality (see above)
- Triggler now provides access to all Token/Actor properties (see **Advanced Trigger** functionality above)
- Brazilian (pt-BR) translation now points to the correct folder
- Hide Names icon no longer shows on Actor sheet when gadget is disabled
- Combat Tracker no longer has an error related to non-existent tokens. (Thanks @awerries !)
- Dragging to highlight text in Condition Lab no longer also selects items on the canvas underneath (eg. tokens) (Thanks @Rawrly85 !)
- Beginning an Encounter with no Combatants no longer causes an error (Thanks @xdy !)
- Active Effect: Durations and flags are now saved as part of the Condition (Thanks @wmudge !)

## [1.3.8] - 2020-12-08
### Added
- Deutsch (German) translation thanks to Acd-Jake#9087 on discord!
- You can now reach the `About Combat Utility Belt` app from the Module Settings menu as well from the CUBputer

### Changed
- Some minor changes to the formatting and structure of the `About Combat Utility Belt` app

### Fixed
- Concentrator no longers duplicates output
- Concentrator respects the `Notify Double Concentration` setting when it is set to `None`
- Castellano (Spanish) translation now points to the correct file

## [1.3.7] - 2020-12-02
### Added
- ‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese) translation (thanks @hmqgg !)
- There is now a (translation-enabled) tooltip on the Hide Names icon on the actor sheet

### Changed
- You can now configure exceptions for Hide Names even if that disposition type is not hidden by default. For example if you choose not to hide `Friendly` names by default, you can now selectively hide an Actor's name from the Hide Names config for that actor

### Fixed
- Hide Names now uses the token disposition from the token instead of the prototype token of the Actor. This resolves situations where you have a `Friendly` goblin, but by default goblins are `Hostile`
- Hide Names now processes names with multiple consecutive spaces correctly (eg. `Ancient  Black Dragon`)
- Hide Names mask icon was being pushed into the next row by vtta-dndbeyond
- Active Conditions are now output during combat when setting enabled
- Concentrator no longer adds two Concentrating conditions to actors that have multiple tokens on the scene
- Refined some logic in Concentrator, which should result in less errors

## [1.3.6] - 2020-11-15
### Changed
- `addCondition` duplicate behaviour has been adjusted to behave more intuitively: when adding a condition with no additional parameters, duplicate conditions will **not** be created. Duplicates can be allowed using the `allowDuplicates` parameter, which now defaults to `false` (previously was `true`). `replaceExisting` parameter usage remains the same.
- Updated ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) translation (thanks @drdwing aka KLO#1490)

### Fixed
- Condition Lab was erasing all Active Effects from Conditions on Save due to a typographical error.
- Triggler was adding duplicate conditions due the previous changes to the `addCondition` API method. The changes in this release fix the issue.

## [1.3.5] - 2020-11-14
### Added
- The Condition Lab now shows a reminder to Save when the current Mapping differs from the saved one. This feature is not fully complete, so you may not receive a reminder on every edit, but actions like changing the Mapping Type or Adding a Row will trigger the reminder.

### Changed
- You can no longer open the Active Effect config for a Condition Lab row until you save the Condition Lab mapping. This prevents issues related to the Condition not existing in the mapping when you try to save the Active Effect

### Fixed
- You can now edit Active Effects on all rows in the Condition Lab
- Clicking the Active Effect button after moving a Condition in the Condition Lab now opens the Active Effect configuration for the correct Condition

## [1.3.4] - 2020-11-14
### Added
- Added a reminder to save the Condition Lab for worlds where Enhanced Conditions is enabled to possibly prevent issues

### Changed
- `addCondition` API method now includes additional options `keepDuplicates` (default: `true`) and `replaceExisting` (default: `false`) which allow you to specify how to deal with existing duplicate Condition Effects already active on the target actor when adding Condition Effects. For example if an Actor is already *Blinded* and you add the *Blinded* Condition again you can now specify to replace the existing Condition like so: `game.cub.addCondition("Blinded", {replaceExisting: true})`
- Roll Hostile Token HP now uses the Actor's name as the Chat Message speaker, which allows Hide Names to work on the message

### Fixed
- Fixed Condition Lab not opening in worlds where the game system was unknown to CUB
- Reroll Initiative no longer rerolls when combat is first started (ie. by clicking Begin Combat)
- Inspiration icon dimensions are now correctly set for use in Foundry
- Condition Lab - Condition Name placeholder text now says `Condition Name` instead of `Icon Path`

### Removed
- Misc Actor - Roll Initiative from Sheet has been removed in favour of the same functionality now built-into Foundry

## [1.3.3] - 2020-10-28
### Changed
- Updated ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) translation (thanks @drdwing aka KLO)

### Fixed
- Duplicated Conditions being created on Actors/Tokens in some circumstances related to existing (ie. pre-CUB-v1.3.0) Condition Lab mappings. The workaround in Known Issue 2 may prevent this behaviour. 
- - *Note: it may be necessary to delete and recreate a token to fully resolve this issue, or alternately create and run a script macro: `game.cub.removeAllConditions()` with the affected token selected, then toggle off any remaining Status Effects in the Token HUD*
- Concentrator no longer ignores the `Enable Concentrator` setting
- Players no longer trigger Concentrator for every spell cast
- `hasCondition` API method should behave more reliably

## [1.3.2] - 2020-10-26
### Changed
- Updated Portugu√™s (Brasil) translation (thanks @rinnocenti!)

### Fixed
- Token disposition is now correctly detected for unlinked Tokens
- Overlay Active Effects added to Tokens are correctly detected

## [1.3.1-hotfix] - 2020-10-24
### Fixed
- Enhanced Condition ids will no longer default to `undefined` prior to saving the Condition Lab. This should resolve known issue 1, however if not, please try the provided workaround.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-10-24
### Changed
- Some API methods have changed again. These are in a state of flux right now, so please monitor the API docs under the `EnhancedConditions` class.

### Fixed
- Enhanced Conditions correctly adds Conditions other than Blinded again
- Enhanced Conditions sets `overlay` type effects correctly again
- Concentrator correctly adds Concentrating condition again
- Concentrator prompts on damage again
- Triggler trigger fire reliably again

## [1.3.0] - 2020-10-21
### Added
- Condition Lab now supports **Active Effects**! A new `Active Effects Config` button appears next to each Condition's name in the Condition Lab. Clicking the button opens the Enhanced Effects Config app that allows you to configure the Active Effects for that Condition.
- New `About CUB` button added to the CUBputer header which provides more info about CUB as well as links to the wiki, DEATH SAVE Discord, and the DEATH SAVE Patreon
- `dnd5e-extended` Condition Map now includes an `Inspiration` Condition
- A number of new translation strings have been added (thank you translators, I am trying to get them all!)

### Changed
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Enhanced Conditions / Condition Lab now uses `Active Effects` to map conditions. All existing mapped conditions are upgraded to Active Effects.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Enhanced Conditions API methods (eg. for macros) have changed. Full details are available in the [API docs](/api.md)
- Enhanced Condition chat messages no longer show the entire set of `Active Conditions` on an Actor/Token when a Condition is added or removed. Instead the message shows only the added/removed Condition/s. The exception to this is during combat if the `Output During Combat` setting is enabled, then the chat message will include all Active Conditions on a token.
- - `Removed Conditions` chat messages: the "Remove Condition" button is now an "Undo Remove" button that allows you to re-add the Condition back to the token if desired.
- Condition Maps `dnd5e` and `dnd5e-extended` now use the system-included `Rules (SRD)` compendium entries as references instead of the CUB-provided `Conditions (D&D5e)` compendium. The CUB compendium is still available for posterity but will be removed in a future release.
- Token Effect Icon sizes have changed. There are now 4 choices from Small to Extra Large. Effect icon size options are now designed to neatly divide the dimensions of the token, for example if `Small` is selected, you can fit 25 (5x5) icons on the token.
- CUBputer no longer defaults to show the faux terminal at the top of the  window. You can re-enable the terminal in the CUBputer options

### Fixed
- Token Status Effect Icons are functional and can be applied from the HUD again.
- Hide Names no longer throws an error during load due to a race condition related to the `canvas`

## [1.2.3] - 2020-10-11
### Added

## [1.2.1] - 2020-09-03
### Changed

- Triggler now correctly replaces an Overlay Condition with another Overlay
- Temporary Combatants no longer causes an error when the game system does not have an `npc` Actor type (eg. Simple Worldbuilding System)

## [1.2] - 2020-08-26
### Added
- Hide Names changes:
- - added settings and default replacement name options for each token disposition: `friendly`, `neutral`, and `hostile`
- - added a form (accessible from the Actor sheet--look for the `mask` icon) for setting whether or not to hide an Actor's name and what the replacement should be
- - added an indicator on: chat messages, combat tracker, and Show Artwork popup, for GM and actor owner if a name has been replaced in chat for other users. Hovering over the icon shows the replacement name
- Triggler now allows triggers with no `Property` (for example if the criteria you want to use for the trigger is only at the `Attribute` level)

### Changed
- Hide NPC Names is now Hide Names
- Concentrator logic improved by using a flag on the chat message to detect if it has assessed the message for possible Concentration spells. This replaces a time-based check
- Enhanced Conditions macro/API method `getConditions` now returns an array of conditions instead of outputting to chat

### Fixed
- Triggler now works for game systems that don't mirror the `dnd5e` Actor model such as `archmage` (13th Age)
- You can now remove token status overlay icons (ie. right-clicked ones) via the Enhanced Conditions chat message, or other methods such as `removeCondition`
- Non-GM players can now set conditions (status icons) on tokens in game systems where this previously was not possible (note: this still only applies to tokens that player controls/has access to)
